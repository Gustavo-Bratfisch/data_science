# Churn Bank

## This projects aims decrease the number of clients that leaves the company (churn) and show the financial return of these clients

#### This project was made by Gustavo Bratfisch.

# 1. Business Problem.

TopBank is a large banking services company. It operates mainly in European countries offering financial products, from bank accounts to investments, passing through some types of insurance and investment product.

The main product of the company is a bank account, which the client can deposit his salary, withdrawals, deposits and transfer to other accounts. The bank account has no cost to the client and it's valid for 12 month, after these 12 month the client has to renew the account for another 12 months.

According to analytics team of TopBank, each client that has an account return a monetery amount of 15% of their estimated salary if it is below of the average salary of all clients and 20% if this salary is above the average. The average and the porcetage of return if calculated annualy.

In the last few month, the Analytics team realized that the rate of customers cancelling their bank account reached unprecedented numbers in the company. Concerned about this high rate, the company contract me as a Data Sciencts to create a plan to reduce the churn rate (rate of customers cancelling their accounts) and show a financial return to the bank. 

At the end of the work, we will delivery a machine learning model in production that return in order all the probability of each client to churn and a report answer these three question:

**1. What is the current churn rate of TopBank? How it varies monthly?**

**2. What is the model performance to classify clients as churn?**

**3. What is the expected return, in terms of revenue, if the company uses its model to avoid customer churn?**

A possible action for retain these clients, is to offer a discount cupom or a tax incentive, which clients do you offer theses discount cupom and what value. Remembering that the sum of the incentives cannot exceed R$10,000.00. 

# 2. Business Assumptions.

- In these project we are working with company data, where each column represent a client.

## 2.1 Data

- RowNumber: The number of the row
- CustomerID: Customer unique identifier
- Surname: The client surname.
- CreditScore: Customer Credit score for the consumer market.
- Geography: The country where the client live.
- Gender: The client gender.
- Age: The client age.
- Tenure: Number of years the customer has been active.
- Balance: The monetary value the client has in his account.
- NumOfProducts:The number of product the client bought of the bank.
- HasCrCard: Indicate if the client has a credit card or not.

- EstimateSalary: Estimate of the client's monthly salary.
- Exited: Indicate if the client leaves or not.
